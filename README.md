This project contains my 2015 B.Eng MATLAB Tricopter simulation files

You can find an article on the project at [10.13140/RG.2.1.1274.2001/1](10.13140/RG.2.1.1274.2001/1) 

### Goal: Simulate a Tricopter using SolidWorks and SimMechanics

### Objectives: 
* Simulate the Tricopter Model
* Control the Tricopter Model

## Useful

To only use the barebones physics model 

* Run the generate_tricopter.m file


To Run the TriTiltPro_V3.slx model successfully

* Install the Simscape Multibody Multiphysics Library.
* Replace the missing Rotational Simscape Interface block


## Important Note

* Some limitations may be overcome by using a better 3D model of a Tricopter
* Note the model has to be edited to ensure its joints can be manipulated in SimMechanics.
* I only achieved Objective 1 to some extent. (The model flew in simulation)
* If you get this to work better and also achieve Objective 2.
